CLASSES REFERENCE
=========================

Hi this is the refenrece for the classes of the library.
The library has two main categories, the first one is the pure python
vector implementation that uses as basic data structure a list of values.
The second part is a set of classes that mirrors the pure math implementation
but under the hood it creates and wires maya nodes, below the list of classes

Pure Math classes

Here you can find a list to all the math based classes
